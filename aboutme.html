<p>Hello, my name is Antonio Contreras and I'm an MSCP sophormore. In the future, the career I wanted to achieve and become successful at is to be a Videogame Developer. 
This is my career choice because I'm a loyal and a helpful worker that can code and work on model or machines to create a neat, realistic
and amazing. This could be the best choice for me in the future.My plan to achieve this career, is to go to college and recieve my bacholar's 
degree. I believe that studying the courses of computer science and engineering which can help develop my career.<br>As an MSCP student, 
I worked on projects and assignments that were complex and difficult.I study and do the work to achieve the hard challeneges in class or tutoring.
My GPA that I have today is 3.83, which I can step up and improve my grades higher in the future.<br>I've worked in many projects from different 
courses over the past semester. In computer science, the project we last worked on was the self-driving vehicles. In the beginning, it was difficult 
to code and use from Vex Coding Studios. But in the end, it was worth it.The vehicles were operating good to move from start to finish that we want to
self-driving vehicle to go from left, right, forward, and etc.It was the best project that I ever accomplished as an MSCP sophormore.<br>
I believe that I'm ready to step up to the next level to start my career in the future. I like to thank the reader who spent their 
time reading this in the beginning and I hope you enjoy for what your about too see in my website.Thank you so much for listening to this and I hope you have a wonderful time,
